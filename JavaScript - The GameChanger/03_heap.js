### **Heap Memory in JavaScript & How It Handles Execution**  

JavaScript uses **Heap Memory** to store objects, functions, and reference-type data during execution. Let's break it down in an easy-to-understand way.  

---

### **1. What is Heap Memory?**  
- The **Heap** is a large, unstructured memory space where JavaScript stores **objects, arrays, and functions**.  
- Unlike the **Call Stack** (which is ordered and follows LIFO), the **Heap is flexible** and allows dynamic memory allocation.  

ðŸ›  **Think of it like:**  
- The **Call Stack** is a **to-do list** (tasks are executed one by one).  
- The **Heap** is a **big warehouse** where JavaScript stores data that needs to stay in memory for some time.

### **2. How Heap Memory Works in Execution?**  

âœ… **Example Code (Using Heap Memory)**
```javascript
let name = "John";  // Stored in Call Stack (Primitive)
let person = { age: 25, city: "New York" };  // Stored in Heap
```
### **Execution Breakdown:**
1. **Primitive values** (like strings and numbers) are stored in the **Call Stack**.
2. **Objects and arrays** are stored in the **Heap**, and only their **references** (memory addresses) are stored in the **Call Stack**.

### **3. How JavaScript Handles Heap Memory?**
#### **A) Reference Behavior (Objects & Arrays in Heap)**
```javascript
let obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
let obj2 = obj1;  // Both point to the same Heap memory

obj2.name = "Bob"; 
console.log(obj1.name); // Output: "Bob" (Same memory reference)
```
ðŸš€ **Why?**  
- `obj1` and `obj2` **both reference the same object in Heap memory**.  
- Changing `obj2.name` **also changes `obj1.name`**.

---

#### **B) Garbage Collection (Automatic Memory Cleanup)**
- JavaScript **automatically removes unused objects** from the Heap using **Garbage Collection (GC)**.
- If an object **is no longer referenced**, JavaScript frees up its memory.  

âœ… **Example (Garbage Collection in Action)**
```javascript
let user = { name: "Sam" };  // Stored in Heap
user = null;  // Now, { name: "Sam" } has no reference â†’ Garbage Collected!
```
ðŸ’¡ **JavaScriptâ€™s engine detects that no variable references `{ name: "Sam" }` anymore, so it deletes it from Heap memory.**

### **4. Summary**
| Concept | Call Stack | Heap Memory |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **What it stores** | Function calls, local variables, primitives | Objects, arrays, functions |
| **Structure** | Ordered (LIFO) | Unordered (Flexible) |
| **How it works** | Push & Pop | Dynamic allocation |
| **Garbage Collection** | Not needed (auto removed) | Cleared when no references exist |

---

### **Final Takeaways**
âœ… **Heap memory stores objects, arrays, and functions.**  
âœ… **JavaScript uses references** to access objects stored in Heap.  
âœ… **Garbage Collection cleans up unused memory automatically.**
